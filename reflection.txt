Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Branches are a powerful and safe way for a team to collaborate on a single project
because they could work on developing features in an isolated environment without
disrupting all the code from before. Some problems that branching might prevent are major
merge conflicts as those can be checked with branches now even if they do arise and workflow
ineffciency since branching can give a stable environment to review code.
